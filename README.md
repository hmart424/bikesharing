Again clear eveidence our customer base is Male.

## Summary

Todays results provided clear evidence that bikeshare services are extremely popular in busy metropolitan areas where its more densly packed and parking spaces are very limited. The customer base is made up mostly males riders, which seems like realiable base. Main usage seems focused around morning and evening commute times. A couple of visualzations that i would recommend more research based solely on female customers such as age range and bike usage to see if there is any correlation. Also average trip duration, by birth year, by gender, to explore diffrences between male and female and age ranges.
